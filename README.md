# Reinforcement_learning_Multilayer_metamaterial

## Ideal RL - HF type, aim for inverse design multilayer metamaterials, while HF aims to predict the ENZ cutoff points for generated materials. 

self-written Transfer matrix method of the multilayer is in the experimental test to validate the outputs.
gym folder is uploaded, no files attached yet. 

PPO testing is on the way. 11/20 /2023 

Further details will be published here once finished the experimental testing.  



This is the side PhD project of inverse design multilayer metamaterial or metasurface. No access now.
