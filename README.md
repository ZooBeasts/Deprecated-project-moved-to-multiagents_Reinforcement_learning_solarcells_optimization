 Reinforcement Learning with Long-Term-Short-Memory for Optical Multi-Coherent-Layer Materials Optimization in Linear and Nonlinear Regimes


 11/JAN 2024 Update:
 We have successfully tested the RL model. Solar cell experiment check is underway. Once confirmed, the Paper will be drafted and published soon.
 However, the code will not be available, it will be used somewhere else and will be available once that project is finished. 

Further details will be published here once the experimental testing.  

### Environment setup
GYM is only runable on Linux. Well, you can do WSL2 on Windows as well.

Spinning up by OPENAI, please follow the official installation process to get the environment ready: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/installation.html

Once finished setting up the Environment, please do everything in your new environment. CARE: Please check your pip and OpenCV version.
